# Hackaton
The project was written on a hackathon using the Python language and the Flask framework in two days. The project is a website-platform for voting for initiatives to improve the city. Unfortunately, it is not finished: the backend part does not have the ability to leave comments and put ratings, the front-end part is written at the basic level to check the functionality of the web-site
